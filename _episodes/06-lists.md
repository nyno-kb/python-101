## A list stores many items in a single structure

Scenario: You have set up an thermometer to do temperature measurements in a storage room for rare books.
*   Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `temperature_001`, `temperature_002`, etc.,
    would be at least as slow as doing them by hand.
*   Use a *list* to store many items together.
    *   List items are contained within square brackets `[...]`.
    *   List items are separated by commas `,`.
    *   List items are ordered by their index number.
*   Use `len` to find out how many items are in a list.

~~~
temperatures = [17.3, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
print('temperatures:', temperatures)
print('length:', len(temperatures))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures: [17.3, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
length: 5
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an item's index to fetch it from a list

*   Just like with strings, we can use index to find a given item in a list.
*   And just like with strings, the elements in a list are 0-indexed. (See lesson about [Data Types]({{page.root}}/01-data-types/index.html#index).)

~~~
print('zeroth item of temperatures:', temperatures[0])
print('fourth item of temperatures:', temperatures[4])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth item of temperatures: 17.3
fourth item of temperatures: 17.6
~~~
{: .output}

## Slice

*   Just like with [strings]({{page.root}}/01-data-types/index.html#slice), we can use indexing syntax to slice lists.
*   If `l` is a list, an expression of the form `l[start:stop]` returns the portion of `l` starting with position `start`, and up to ***but not including*** position `stop`.
*   Take a look at the example with the list of temperatures:

~~~
print(temperatures)
print(temperatures[1:4])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[17.3, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
[17.5, 17.7, 17.5]
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists' items can be replaced by assigning to them

Use an index expression on the left of the assignment operator (`=`) to replace a value:

~~~
temperatures[0] = 16.5
print('temperatures is now:', temperatures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures is now: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
~~~
{: .output}

## Appending items to a list lengthens it

Use `list_name.append` to add items to the end of a list:

~~~
print('temperatures is initially:', temperatures)
temperatures.append(17.9)
temperatures.append(18.2)
print('temperatures has become:', temperatures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures is initially: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
temperatures has become: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6, 17.9, 18.2]
~~~
{: .output}

*   `append` is a *method* of lists.
    *   Like a function, but tied to a particular object.
*   Use `object_name.method_name` to call methods.
*   Use `help(list)` for a preview.

## Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely

*   `del list_name[index]` removes an item from a list and shortens the list.
*   Not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

~~~
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
print('numbers before removing last item:', numbers)
del numbers[4]
print('numbers after removing last item:', numbers)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
numbers before removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
numbers after removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

## The empty list contains no items

*   Use `[]` on its own to represent a list that doesn't contain any items.
    *   "The zero of lists."
*   Helpful as a starting point for collecting values
    (which we will see in the next episode about [For Loops]({{page.root}}/06-for-loops/)).

## Lists may contain items of different types

A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.

~~~
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
print(goals)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists are mutable

In Python, _mutable_ data types, such as lists, are data structures that can be modified or changed after they are created. This means you can add, remove, or modify elements within a list without creating a new list.

For example, you can append new items, insert items at specific positions, remove items, and change the values of existing items in a list. This behavior contrasts with _immutable_ data types, like integers, floats, and strings, where once created, their contents cannot be altered without creating a new object. (This was briefly mentioned in the lesson about [Variables and Assignment]({{page.root}}/02-variables-and-assignment/index.html#use-variables-to-store-values).)

## Character strings are immutable

Remember that you can get single characters from a character string using indexes in square brackets:

~~~
element = 'carbon'
print('zeroth character:', element[0])
print('third character:', element[3])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth character: c
third character: b
~~~
{: .output}

<br/>
***But!***

*   You cannot alter the characters in a string after it has been created.
    *   *Immutable*: cannot be changed after creation. E.g., strings.
    *   In contrast, lists are *mutable*: they can be modified in place.
*   Python considers the string to be a single value with parts,
    not a collection of values.

~~~
element[0] = 'C'
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .error}

*   Lists and character strings are both *collections*.

> ## Notice the difference between overwriting and changing values
>
> In Python, when you use the assignment operator (`=`) with a variable (*and not a variable index!*), 
> it doesn't change the original value of the variable. 
> Instead, it replaces the current value of the variable with the new value on the right-hand side of the assignment.
>
> ~~~
> element = 'carbon'
> print(element)
> element = 'helium'
> print(element)
> ~~~
> {: .python}
> ~~~
> carbon
> helium
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> In the code above, the variable `element` initially holds the value 'carbon', but when the second line is executed, it is overwritten with the new value 'helium'.
> The old value 'carbon' is effectively discarded, and `element` now contains 'helium'.
>
> In contrast, when assigning to a list index:
>
> ~~~
> elements = ['carbon', 'helium']
> print(elements)
> elements[0] = 'hydrogen'
> print(elements)
> ~~~
> {: .python}
> ~~~
> ['carbon', 'helium']
> ['hydrogen', 'helium']
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> We don't overwrite the variable `elements` but rather we change the content of the zeroth index.\
> Thus, the difference between *immutable* and *mutable* data types.

## Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error

*   Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist.
    *   This is a kind of [runtime error]({{page.root}}/04-built-in-functions-and-help/index.html#python-reports-a-runtime-error-when-something-goes-wrong-while-a-program-is-executing).

~~~
print('99th element of element is:', element[99])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
IndexError: string index out of range
~~~
{: .output}
